# EECS230 Lab9
In this lab, we will work on `Template` and `Inheritance` through exercises.

# Exercises
## Template </br>
1. Implement template functions for (1) summing of two numbers (or objects) and (2) choosing the max value between two numbers. </br>
2. Write a test case with a different type of numbers in main(). </br> </br>
3. Create a new struct of your choice, and show that it could be passed as arguments into the Template<typename T> functions you created.

## Inheritance </br>
3. Implement a function, `area()`, in `Rectangle` class, and discuss it with your partner. </br>
4. Implement another class, `Triangle`, derived from `Polygon`. and write the similar test code in main(). </br>
5. Insert code that prints out "[className]::constructor()" in both the Polygon and subclass constructors. Which is called first? Discuss about it with your partner. </br>
